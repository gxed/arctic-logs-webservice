that a draconian camp has once been here.

506H 143V 3514286X 3624C Exits:D> The Reception
Although this inn does not look very reputable, at least it has warm
beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A
small counter stands here with a little brass bell, although you should not
use it for fear that the receptionist gets angry. It looks as if she has
had a hard day already.

506H 143V 3514286X 3624C Exits:D> The Seedy Inn
The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt
has been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner. Jeering
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.
