Heres a log of the battle in neraka. I believe that these logs should be
studied carefully so that we can learn from our mistakes; i will include
some comments and my thoughts during the fight in the text. This is not
trying to be any kind of lesson, just analyzing the battle from my
view and opinions.

I came to the group very late and claimed the charge from bilenz who told
me bashers were already assigned and we were ready for battle. Do not
trust this person to lead any battles, he is very self-confident, but not
qualified.
