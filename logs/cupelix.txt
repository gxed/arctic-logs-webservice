----------
Just a quick question, I lost access to my internet provider for a week, 
possibly more. It took one hell of a fight just to get on here going
through three systems. Anyway, is there nothing I can do to be able to
have a backup domain address? My rent is gonna get blown to hell and back
cause I can't log on from one of the other many sites available to me.
