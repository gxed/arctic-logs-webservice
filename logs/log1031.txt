Twinkling lights surround you and cover your body entirely.
When they disappear, you find yourself somewhere else.

14H 140V 8368412X 428C Exits:U> The Pit Of Shame
You find yourself in a large pit of shame, probably because you lost
this round. Please wait here until the round is over. The fountain will
provide food and water. For those wishing to go home, the portal will
take
you there.
A large stone fountain with a sign on it sits in the middle of the
room.
You see Tanglefoot hiding in the shadows.
You see Shorne hiding in the shadows.
You see Promina hiding in the shadows.
Zug Zug, Happy Sunflower Barbarian is standing here.
Crysania, Revered Daughter of Paladine, stands here to further instruct
you.
