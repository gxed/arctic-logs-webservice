The Reception
Although this inn does not look very reputable, at least it has warm
beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A
small counter stands here with a little brass bell, although you should
not
use it for fear that the receptionist gets angry. It looks as if she
has
had a hard day already.

The Seedy Inn
The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt has
been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against
the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner.
Jeering

A Cobbled Lane
Nearing the town crossroads, the buildings get bigger and seemingly
better kept. The scorch marks have been replaced with a grubby shade of
white-wash. The sounds of breaking wood can be heard from the inn to
the
west. The center of town, the crossroads, lies to the south.

The lane leads north-south, into the quiet and strange town. There is a
small sign here, making you aware of the inn nearby. To the east lies
the
only stretch of greenery in Neraka - once. What was obviously a small
park
has been ruthlessly burnt, signs of campfires and tent markings suggest
that a draconian camp has once been here.
