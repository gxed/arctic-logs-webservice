The Path of Puddles
Harsh winds and piercing rain pummels you as you make your way along
this path. The path itself is more like a shallow river that leads
north,
towards what you assume would be the keep. Through the dense fog and
the
constant barrage of rain blurring your vision you can see the large
gates
to the keep a short distance off to your north. You hasten your steps,
hoping to get out of this storm, either by forcing your way into the
shelter of the keep, or by letting yourself get captured.

At the Great Gate of Storm's Keep
Looming before you are the great adamantite gates of Storm's Keep.
Detailing of lilies and borders of thorns accent the otherwise bland
doors.
Flanking the dark metal gates are high walls of blackened stone worn
smooth
by the constant beating of the rain. The wicked wind whips about your
face
wreathing about your body and chilling you to the bone. Lining the top
of
the wall are a couple of uninterested soldiers and a pair of stone
guardians, shaped like dragons and carved to resemble the living. The
overall affect is quite frightening and it puts an awkward weight upon
your
shoulders and quickens the already rapid beat of your heart.

A Curious Landing
A large, smooth chunk of rock juts out from the island here overlooking
the swirling and churning ocean. The landing seems quite safe and
appears
to be one of the favorite unloading spots for people coming to and from
the
island. Through the swirling mist and pounding rain you can barely make
out
the faint outline of a vast and dark keep to your north. It is hard to
get
a good focus on the keep from this vantage due to the strange weather
that
seems to have gripped the isle. There seems to be a path leading north
from
here.
