Feroz Fodder vs. World

POV: Irvine

Log Rating: 0.0000

Terk decided to run a 2 round mini-terny which was a lot of fun. We had
a crap group but decided to try to make the most of it. We were ranked
4/6 with 7 kills total (less with a healer!).

ROUND 1 ---
I was blessed with the wonderful players feroz kholos ronsy and
randomdude #5 who didn't even skill guard.
We didn't have a chance, I hoped to kill off some other groups clerics
out of rage that we didn't get one!
