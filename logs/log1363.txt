The Tight Passage
The passage is barely passable, but it can be done. To the west, a few
dwarves on top of the wall peer down and laugh at your efforts to pass
through. To the north, the passage continues, while southward, you see
the
main gates of the keep. Two passes cut into the middle of the passage
towards the east and west. A stable looms to the west, while you are
unable
to make out what lies beyond the pass to the east.

The Gates of Thorbardin
Before you stand two huge brass gates leading into the keep of
Thorbardin. Upon the walls around the keep, many dwarves keep watch
over
the surrounding countryside. As you stand here, several peer down at
you as
to determine what you are doing here. From within, noises of many
merchants
yelling out their great prices echo. To the north and south, small
paths
lead around the cliff upon which the keep stands, while a path to the
east
leads back down the mountain.

The Passageway Around the Keep
The passage way between the keep walls and the piles of boulders is
just wide enough for a fair-size adventuring party to pass through. The
boulders look unsteady and you would hate to have to climb up on them,
but
thankfully don't look like there will be an avalanche. To the north,
the
path opens up and you can see the main gates of the keep, while to the
south, the passageway continues.
