Southern Road
A massive, charred crater is all that remains of the southeastern part
of the city. Whatever struck this city and left it in its ruined state
must
have rivaled the destructive force of the Cataclysm to have levelled
this
large a section of the city. Despite it's poor condition, the road
leading
west is in much better condition than the road that once lead eastward.

Old Tarsis Square
Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the
city.

Northern Road
The city square lies just to the south, where the sounds of children
laughing and other familiar city sounds filled the air. Now there is an
eery silence, save for the noises that you make. This road runs
north-south, joining the cities fountain with the it's northern gate,
while
a narrow street leads east, towards the remains of an important looking
building.

Before the Courthouse
The building to the south once served as the city hall and courthouse
for Tarsis. Even now, in its dilapidated state, the building still has
an
air of importance and authority. One of the main city roads lies to the
west, while the road leads eastward, towards the cities former markets.

Pierre's Fine Tarsis Ham
Somehow, this restaurant has survived the devastation, destruction and
decay of time and remains as immaculate as the day it was last seen on
Krynn. The fragrant scent of ham still lingers in the air, making your
mouth water and your stomach growl. Some divine power has protected
this
place, and for reasons unknown to you, this place feels very important.

East Gate
All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once
stood tall.

Before the Bank
The broken road leading to the cities bank crunches and cracks beneath

city to
ruin, then withstanding the gradual decay of time has left this road in
a
dismal state of ruin. Small chips of stone and gravel crunch beneath
your
feet and the floor is cracked and broken in several places, leaving the
floor very uneven and difficult to traverse.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

The Back Alley
Even though the walls of the city are crumbling and large portions of

once frequented this place, preying on hapless library-goers that had
lost
their way. The library itself rests to the south, a shattered, pathetic
shell of its former glory.

Lost Knowledge
Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics
and
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust.
The
countless shelves that were once lined with books are nowhere to be
seen
amidst the rubble.

its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone

Lost Knowledge
Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics
and
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust.
The
countless shelves that were once lined with books are nowhere to be
seen
amidst the rubble.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

The Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
scashells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes,
roofs have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

East Gate
All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once
stood tall.

Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of

bringing

is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

A massive, charred crater is all that remains of the southeastern part
of the city. Whatever struck this city and left it in its ruined state
must
have rivaled the destructive force of the Cataclysm to have levelled
this

leading
west is in much better condition than the road that once lead eastward.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

The steel bars that make up the fence that separate the park from the
rest of the city are horribly twisted and mangled here at the
southeastern
corner of the park. A single, small building can be seen a short
distance
to the northwest, but aside from that, there is very little to look at

This dry, dusty pathy leads north-south through the old Tarsis park.
This park was once full of life, a lush, vibrant forest rich with color

sound, but now it is a desolate, lonely place. The entire west half of
the
park has been replaced with a giant crater.

Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis

others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

The Back Alley
Even though the walls of the city are crumbling and large portions of
it are missing, this back-alley is still cast in shadows. Various thugs
once frequented this place, preying on hapless library-goers that had
lost
their way. The library itself rests to the south, a shattered, pathetic
shell of its former glory.

East Gate
All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and

collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a

Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful

discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

665H 55V 13822X 1712C Exits:N> lA Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

The Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to

area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

The Tarsis Wastelands
The faint smell of decaying trash wafts in from the west on an unfelt

leaving the dump unused, the prominent smell of garbage will probably
linger here for some time still to come.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

and towards the park. Immediately to the south is a row of broken

Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the
city.

Weeds separated and broken through the stone tiles that once made up

huge,
ominous crater.

All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a

stood tall.

All that is left of the road to the north is a huge pile of rubble. The

The state of the road has long since fallen from its former grace. This
once busy, bustling market road has seen few travelers in recent times.
Skeletons of the buildings that once bordered the road are all that is
left, save the restaurant to the east that has somehow, miraculously
survived all this time.
464H 70V 13822X 1712C Exits:NES> nThe Ruined Market
Broken stone tiles crunch under your feet; the massive stone tiles that
once endured the footfalls of men and horses alike lie shattered and
broken
here. The surrounding buildings are in the same condition: several have
missing walls and roofs while others have entirely collapsed onto
themselves.
464H 69V 13822X 1712C Exits:NSW> nThe Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.
464H 68V 13822X 1712C Exits:NESW> nWall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Remnants of the guard tower still sit atop the walls of the city here,
although not nearly enough to remain usable. Splinters of wood are all
that
remains of the supporting beams and the ladder that were once used to
gain
access to the tower.
464H 65V 13822X 1712C Exits:EW> wThe Northern Park Entrance
Twisted, crushed iron, painted in rust, is all that remains of the
fence and gate that used to separate the park from the city. The grass
that
once bordered the path into the park has been replaced by dust while
the
path itself has been broken by weeds.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

Once, these Wastelands served as a walking ground for muggers,
prostitutes, thieves and the like, but now it is dead and barren. The
remains of a large ship that was grounded here can be seen to the
south,
but it had collapsed onto itself a long time ago, destroying whatever
might

Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered

hollowed

have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

The Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time

invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure

it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of

surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is

was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends

Near the Tarsis Wastelands
Dry dust stirs into small clouds with every step you take. The road
here appears to be unfinished, the stone tiles give way to dirt and
sand as
it approaches the wastelands. There air here is dry, and there is an
unnerving stillness here.

The Tarsis Wastelands
The faint smell of decaying trash wafts in from the west on an unfelt

leaving the dump unused, the prominent smell of garbage will probably
linger here for some time still to come.

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

A Shattered Gate
The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
These
gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
that
it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
rest
on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
solid.

The Tarsis Dump
A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
wind is
penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
cart
would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
stirs.
There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
what
you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
their
once peaceful lives covered with filth.

prostitutes, thieves and the like, but now it is dead and barren. The
remains of a large ship that was grounded here can be seen to the
south,
but it had collapsed onto itself a long time ago, destroying whatever
might
have been in it.
