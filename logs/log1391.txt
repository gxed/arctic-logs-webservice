Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics
and
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not
crushed, burned or otherwise destroyed has long since turned to dust.
The

East Gate
All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once
stood tall.

Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These

broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a

All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once
stood tall.
