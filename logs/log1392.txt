The Courthouse
The open shell of this building is all that remains of the former
courthouse. The ceiling has long since caved in, leaving the interior
of
the building exposed to the environment. The attached jail cells have
been
crushed by the building, but you see no signs of their former
occupants.
Most likely they fled during the chaos of whatever ravaged this city.

Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed

Old Tarsis Square
Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
shell
of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
shattered
and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the
city.
