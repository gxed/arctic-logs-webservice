North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn

Before the Library
Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes
containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics
and
countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not

The

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Before the Forge
Once, many warriors frequented this section of town. Between the
weapons shop to the south, the inn just a short distance to the west
and
the bar to the north, everything a young warrior needed could be found
here. Now, the only thing left of the building to the north is a pile
of
rubble and the shop to the south has long since been deserted.

A massive, charred crater is all that remains of the southeastern part
of the city. Whatever struck this city and left it in its ruined state
must
have rivaled the destructive force of the Cataclysm to have levelled
this
large a section of the city. Despite it's poor condition, the road
leading
west is in much better condition than the road that once lead eastward.

others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
Great
Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
from
its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
time
and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
invaders is
little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

East Gate
All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once
stood tall.

The Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

The stone tiles of this road have long since lost their form and
structure: the road here is uneven and cracked, even missing in some
parts.
Broken stone and gravel speckle the road, causing each footfall to
create
an eery "crunching" sound. The main road runs north, towards the city
gates, and south, towards the fountain and city square. A smaller road
leads eastward towards the market.

North Gate
The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
area
and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
common
criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
as
an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
torn
out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

Wall Road
Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
bringing
a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
is
blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

The Ruined Market
Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
area
was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
hollowed
shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
have
collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
rubble.

gates
once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
broken it
down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
in a
sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once

Outside the Tarsis Inn
The Tarsis Inn, to the west, is one of the few buildings that remains
mostly intact. The sign that once hung above the inns door has nearly
fallen from its perch: it hangs by a single hook now, ready to fall and
shatter itself onto the cobblestone road.

Before the Forge
Once, many warriors frequented this section of town. Between the
weapons shop to the south, the inn just a short distance to the west
and
the bar to the north, everything a young warrior needed could be found
here. Now, the only thing left of the building to the north is a pile
of
rubble and the shop to the south has long since been deserted.

This large room has long since been emptied. Whatever was not destroyed
when this city was ravaged had been looted in the aftermath. The

training ground that once resided to the east is no more.
