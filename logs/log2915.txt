Naked druid trying to land a para on a mage..

On a Vallenwood Tree Above Solace Square
The sturdy boughs of this particularly huge vallenwood tree extend to
both the north and south. Various structures have been built on the
boughs,
some rather haphazardly. It is a wonder that some of these structures
have
not fallen on someone's head below but this is what gives Solace its
charm.
A thick branch leads to the west, linking a canopy walk to a
neighboring
vallenwood tree.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
A mercury golem, Janx, stands here, its body incessantly flowing.
<BST> Malygos Dragoon, Time Worn Druid of the Ether is standing here.

A beautiful elven woman dressed in white robes stands here.
A citizen of Solace moves quickly about.
A Solace peacekeeper stands here, holding the peace.

Janx the mercury golem arrives from above.
Solace Square
Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and
their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The
clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high
spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a
huge
vallenwood which bough supports a collection of huts and buildings. A
small spiral staircase leads up around the trunk of the tree and into
the
thick limbs which house the buildings.
A long torch functions as a street lamp here.
A large fountain sits in the middle of the road, taking up space.
A mercury golem, Janx, stands here, its body incessantly flowing.
A Solace peacekeeper is here making his rounds.

The Halls of Beast Clan
The stench of sweat and grime hits you like a charging remorhaz as
you enter the room. Not surprising, given how active your clan has been
lately. It seems like they have single handedly rid Krynn of the last
of
the dragons and pulled down all the strongholds of the greatest lords
and
leaders. Yet somehow more pop up each day and your Clan fights on to
bring order and domination to the world. The bright fireplace warms the
room and provides the light for you to see your way to the bar and
check
in desk. Several waiters and waitresses bustle too and fro, bringing
the
much needed ale and sustenance to the worn out heroes. A bell hop
stands
by the check in desk, ready to stow your gear. The concierge stands by,
ready to collect your Clan contribution before you head upstairs to
your
room and rest.
You notice some bloody footprints on the ground.
A small wooden chest rests here. [2]

The Loft Hills
Sloping down here, this hill is literally covered with mountain goats
grazing on grass. Clouds pass overhead, and the air is fresh and clean.
The
path itself is dark and of clay, and a few rocks skirt it. It doesn't
look
as if many people pass through here.

The Loft Hills
The Loft Hills are a system of small, rounded, lush hills near the town
of Neraka. Soft breezes wind through the green grasses and small
patches of
wildflowers. Looking down into the valley, you see tall trees, lush

The Blood Sea of Istar
The waves of red slap against you, staining your clothes. Although only
rumoured that the red coloring is from the blood of the lost people of
Istar, the water is certainly thicker than you would expect. Nothing
but
emptiness can be seen on the red horizon. The swirling red waters give
away
no sign of life in their bloody depths.
A piece of crimson-colored seaweed can be seen resting here.

Navigating Blood Bay
The crimson waters of Blood Bay roll gently here towards the southern
shores, driven by the tumultuous presence of the Blood Sea to the
northeast. Red-stained seaweed floats casually by, and although fairly
opaque you catch a glimpse of fish and bigger prey gliding 'neath the
water's surface.

Upon the Shallow Waters
You find yourself upon the shallow waters that line the coast of the
Blood Bay. The water has a faint color of red here as it carries the
reddish brown silt from the storms which rage in the middle of the
Blood
Sea. The water here is calm however and fish can be seen roaming and
darting through the shallow waters below through large stands of
seaweed.
A swarm of insects fills the area. [2]
