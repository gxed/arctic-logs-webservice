Subject: The fight
Date: Monday, March 29, 1999 1:30 PM

  After a long break, since January, while Ahma did'nt fight with
us, they were preparing I belive. Right before we end up zoning
and were going to rent/sleep, they mass logged and we decided to
fight them.
  Don't blame I did'nt do much for fight. I just
logged on this time only for quick transfer, I was on the work
and could'nt play realy. But I decided to stay and fresh people
while moving. Also russian slow day link prevented me from
casting well. Shit happens, but we won vs 13 people without lose
