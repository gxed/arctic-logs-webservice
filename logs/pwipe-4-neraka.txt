A Cobbled Lane
     The lane leads north-south, into the quiet and strange town. There is
a small sign here, making you aware of the inn nearby. To the east lies the
only stretch of greenery in Neraka - once. What was obviously a small park
has been ruthlessly burnt, signs of campfires and tent markings suggest
that a draconian camp has once been here.
