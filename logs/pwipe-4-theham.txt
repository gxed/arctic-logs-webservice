beds and anyhow, it is safer than sleeping in the streets of Neraka. A

had a hard day already.

     The blood stained floor is evident as soon as you enter. No attempt
has been made to hide last night's brawl. Obviously, such violence is
commonplace. Looking around, the locals hiss at you and sneer back into
their watered ale. A long bar, once made from fine oak, stands against the
far wall. The many ales are displayed in their kegs in a corner. Jeering
and shouts can be heard from the backroom to the north.
