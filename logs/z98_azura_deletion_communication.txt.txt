Events that led to the deletion of Azura, which in my opinion was
executed far too hastily, and was unjustified in the whole. As a
background info should note that Azura had for a few days had a habit
of checking wanted_board and summoning all people who he didn't
recognize as a friend.

This file contains all communication related to Azura preceding the
deletion.
